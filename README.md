paris price landing page artist promo

Conceptual Design:
A immersive experience into the artists content

\*Goals:

- minimalist design throughout the pages structure; make everything interactive: icons, logo, buttons, etc.
- slideshow video/tv container to autoplay muted content
- hide bio section behind slideshow. Reveal on logo click
- footer contains text entry field for sub. include contact information

  /////////////STRUCTURE/////////////

  \*NAVBAR:

- all icons will link directly to an asset outside of the webage; performance dates/ticket sales, film content, social media pages
- create a custom logo; /Paris Price\ flickering as a neon light. when clicked, a pop up card appears.

\*FOOTER:

- The footer should contain a submition box for subscriptions; alerts fans via newsletter. clean and simple
- contact, terms and conditions, privacy policy, consumer/transaction policy

\*BODY:

- make the popup the bio information card. inspiration design from twitter profile account
- make the card appear like foggy glass. opac enough to see the video content still playing behind it.

* make the cards corners round

- use a banner image full width of the card with padding
